> That a good idea?
> Can you build a new map out of that?
> Or at least modify what I've got and make it more worthwhile?
> I want a new temple, if possible. If we do rebuild it, can ya plz make a new pyramid? Not a cone, but a pyramid?

- Abandoned military base northwest.
	- Yes, a barracks and a base.
	- With a garage for tanks, etc.
	- And possibly a hanger.

	- The temple should have several layers below it with catacombs.
	- Coffins should be device_machinery.
		- The lids can come off and come on.
	- With some lighting down below and the main hall should have a glassy, marble-like floor that's jet black or very dark.
	- The walls should be very ornate and well designed.
