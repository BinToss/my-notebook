- I need a way to mark a tagset or project as Sauced in a way that makes Invader label the current directory or tag as such (highlighting in terminal?)	
Would this allow us to take advantage of map compression?

#### Commands, Parameters
`Invader [command] --OpenSauce` to enable OS extensions for this command
