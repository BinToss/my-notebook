```
Attempt to execute non-executable address 0019d0d8

FAILED_INSTRUCTION_ADDRESS: 
+0
0019d0d8 0000 add byte ptr [eax],al
```

Judging by the instructions,
The ptr (pointer) is pointing to `[eax],al` which seems to be a 32-bit value.
	• An EAX register is a 32-bit value and it contains the return value of a function call.
This `ADD` operation is adding AL, an 8-bit value, to EAX—a 32-bit value
Another way to write this would be `EAX = EAX + AL`
Or
`87654321 + 21`

This instruction is not allowed to be executed because it is in a non-executable memory range.
	• Why is this memory range non-executable?
	• What set this range as non-executable?
	• What is responsible for adding an executable instruction to a non-executable address?

Shelly says this is part of the stack. That helps.
Tracing the stack back reveals that this was caused by dinput8!DirectInput8Create
	Definitely Open Sauce, but I already knew that.
