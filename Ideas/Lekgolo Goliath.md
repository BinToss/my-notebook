> That got me thinking about Hunter assassinations. Hunters already had their place in the SPV3 sandbox and seemed a little small and not quite qualified for their own special takedown. I thought about HW2's lekgolo leader which, iirc, is a 2in1 Hunter. This new unit could be about 2x/3x the height of a Hunter.

> How will the takedown be initiated? The player can bulletsponge the Lekgolo's unarmored joints and exposed bits between armor plates until it is in a weakened behavior state. Meanwhile, it is attempting to protect its weak points with its huge shield. Alt., the player can use a gravity grenade or charged Void Tear nearby, causing the Lekgolo's to lockdown to prevent itself from losing balance similar to HW's Rhinos and Cobras. When this happens, it becomes open to AI/actor boarding. The player interacts with it, triggering a 3rd person anim of the player climbing onto the Lekgolo's back. The player then jams a grenade (preferably gravity grenade) into the Lekgolo's exposed back (armor destroyed) or neck. Destroyed from inside. Big hole in the corpse eg DOOM2016's mancubi.
> Unit placement: Best suited to large areas. Hulking mass should have room to fight & maneuver. Transported by Phantoms like wraiths.
> Danger level: can handle tanks but not too dangerous for player on foot. Can cycle weapons. If not feasible, tie to behavior states like elites' primary and sword/voids tear. Armed with massive shield to protect itself.
> Names? Siege, Bastion, Predator, Stalker, Apex, Lone Hunter, Titan, etc

Halo Wars 2 called them Goliaths.
