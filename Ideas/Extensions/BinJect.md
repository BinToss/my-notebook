Originally proposed in Discord/Chimera


> We need a DirectX-less method for injecting images into Halo's memory
> For medals, button prompts, replacing existing textures (I'm thinking of my Dynamic UI concept, but the Latino modding community would love it for other reasons). On that last note, it might also be used for replacing font bitmaps...
> Now, I'd prefer that this be a mod/extension separate from Chimera.
> A library for other mods to use and for users to apply texturepacks. hmmm...use pointers to choose new areas in memory for larger-than-original replacement all injected bitmaps
