> Here's an idea. Dynamic main menu. Rather than pre-defining maps, images, and menu section into a custom main menu (a la UUI), dynamically add them by... A. (Simpler) scanning the maps folder and adding maps to a maps list in the menu. A GUI for mapname. B. (Complex, but better for end users) adding menu buttons and sub-menus via drop-in Lua scripts. The scripts would be written by map authors and used creating menu sections for map packs (custom campaigns, Firefight playlists, et cetera) Optional images (Logos/Banners, map previews) would need to be either in the script file as a blob or as a separate image file in a subdirectory to declutter the menu scripts folder. Now that I think about it, I'd already suggested something similar for TiaraCE‚Ä¶

> @nToss that sounds cool. unfortunately, you just broke the universal UI as well as pretty much other UI map that isn't stock

> The dynamically-created buttons (Campaign, Firefight, Multiplayer) and their respective submenus would likely need to either replace the stock buttons (assuming the ui author used stock-named tags for button entries) or add them if they are not already present (Add Firefight to a stock-ish ui) To account for tag fuckery, an algorithm would be needed to look for strings within the tags (search for "campaign", "campa√±a", et cetera) and (optionally) attempt to translate these common strings to other languages. Don't both with long, custom strings provided by map authors. That's their job, not yours/whoever-wants-to-try-implementing this.(edited)
