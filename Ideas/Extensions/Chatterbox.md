At game UI, press a hotkey to open chatterbox menu
Chatterbox UI will be tabbed.
Each tab will be dedicated to one plug in and the last tab will be dedicated to unrecognized plugins.
Selecting a tab will show the update history of that plug-in.
Additionally, at the top of each plug-in update history, a pinned message will show a link to the homepage of that plug, if available.
Fetches for the update histories should be done asynchronously.
Additionally, the fetches must have a timeout.
Force-end fetches connections when leaving the menu
